I appreciate the effort you put in, especially taking the time to think through the problem and asking clarifying questions.  \n\n**What went well:**  \n- You quickly identified the need for sorting and the two‑pointer technique, which is the optimal approach for this problem.  \n- Your communication was clear—you explained your thought process out loud, which is exactly what interviewers look for.  \n\n**Areas to improve:**  \n- When you hit a roadblock, try to write a small stub or a quick sketch of the core loop; even a partial implementation shows progress and can reveal bugs early.  \n- Make sure to run at least one simple test case before moving on; that helps catch off‑by‑one errors and confirms the logic works.  \n- Practice handling edge cases (e.g., empty input, duplicates) so you can discuss them confidently even if you run out of coding time.  \n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Keep practicing the classic “sort‑and‑two‑pointer” pattern on similar problems; it will become second nature.  \n- Work on writing a minimal, testable version of your code early on, then iterate.  \n\nOverall, you demonstrated solid problem‑solving instincts and clear communication. With a bit more focus on incremental coding and quick validation, you’ll be well positioned for future interviews. Keep up the good work, and best of luck with the next round!",
