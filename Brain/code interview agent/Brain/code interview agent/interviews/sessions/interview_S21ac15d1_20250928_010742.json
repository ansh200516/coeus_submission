I’m an AI interviewer here to guide you through today’s coding session.  \nWe’ll spend about 20 minutes on a medium‑difficulty problem: **Reverse Words in a String**. The format is simple—you’ll hear the prompt, you can ask any clarifying questions, and then you’ll write the core solution. The surrounding boilerplate and driver code are already provided, so you only need to implement the function that does the work.  \n\nFeel free to think aloud, ask for hints, or request examples at any time. We’re here to collaborate and learn together, so let’s have a fun, supportive conversation. Ready to get started?",

            "content": "I see you’ve taken a moment to think—nice, that’s often where the good ideas start to surface. Could you walk me through what you’re considering for reversing the words in the string? For example, are you picturing how you might split the input, handle any extra spaces, and then put the words back together in reverse order? Feel free to talk out any edge cases you’re thinking about or any parts that feel a bit unclear. I’m here to help you flesh out the approach, so just share whatever’s on your mind.",

            "content": "Hey Harsh, great effort on tackling the “Reverse Words in a String” problem. I appreciated how quickly you jumped into the discussion—your willingness to ask clarifying questions and think out loud shows strong problem‑solving instincts. You identified the key steps, such as splitting the string and reversing the order, which is exactly the right approach for this task.\n\nSince you didn’t get a chance to submit final code, the next step would be to translate that plan into a working implementation and run a quick test case. That will help you spot any edge cases—like multiple spaces or leading/trailing whitespace—early on. Also, try to keep an eye on time management so you can finalize and submit your solution within the interview window.\n\nOverall, you demonstrated solid analytical thinking and good communication. Keep practicing turning those ideas into code quickly, and you’ll feel even more confident in future interviews. You’re on the right track—keep it up!",
