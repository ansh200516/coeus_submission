I’m an AI interviewer here to guide you through today’s coding session.  \nWe’ll spend about 20 minutes on a medium‑difficulty problem: **Longest Palindromic Substring**.  \n\nThe surrounding boilerplate and driver code are already provided, so you only need to implement the core solution function.  \n\nFeel free to ask any clarifying questions at any time—let’s keep this a two‑way conversation and enjoy solving it together!",

            "content": "Harsh, thank you for taking the time to work through the longest‑palindromic‑substring problem today. I appreciate that you approached the prompt promptly and engaged in the brief interaction we had—that shows willingness to dive in and ask clarifying questions when needed. Even though you didn’t get to submit a complete solution this time, your initial attempt indicated you were thinking about the core idea of expanding around a center, which is a solid strategy for this problem.\n\nGoing forward, consider sketching out a quick high‑level plan on paper or in comments before you start coding; that can help you organize thoughts and catch edge cases early. Also, try to run at least one simple test case locally as you write the function—this habit often reveals bugs or missing logic before the interview ends. Practicing the “expand‑around‑center” or dynamic‑programming approaches on a few extra examples will boost confidence and speed.\n\nKeep up the positive attitude and don’t be discouraged by incomplete code—each interview is a learning opportunity. With a bit more practice on structuring solutions and validating them incrementally, you’ll be able to deliver complete implementations in the time allowed. I look forward to seeing your continued growth in future interviews.",
