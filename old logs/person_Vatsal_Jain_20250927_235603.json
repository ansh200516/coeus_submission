  "about": "IIT Delhi's Electrical and Electronics Engineering program has equipped me with a solid foundation in problem-solving, teamwork, and technical excellence. During my Software Engineer Internship at Atlassian, I contributed to enhancing their data orchestration platform by enabling critical features, improving agility, and ensuring data lineage preservation, leveraging tools like Python, Airflow, and DBT.\n\nAs Technical Secretary, I spearheaded the first-ever Tech General Championship, driving innovation and collaboration. I also developed and maintained the TRYST website using React.js and Django, ensuring real-time updates for IIT Delhi’s annual tech fest. Focused on impactful projects, I aim to apply my technical expertise to solve complex challenges and foster growth in dynamic environments.",
